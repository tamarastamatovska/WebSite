      After graduating from college, my primary goal is to become a successful software developer. I understand that becoming a software architect is a
      long-term ambition that requires experience and knowledge in the field.
      It's crucial to recognize that software architecture is a role typically attained through career progression and
      accumulated expertise in software development. Therefore, I am aware that I won't be able to immediately become a software
      architect upon graduation. Instead, I will focus on honing my skills and gaining practical experience as a software developer.
      By doing so, I will lay a solid foundation for my future growth and eventually achieve my goal of becoming a successful software architect.

    <h3 id="headingSoftwarearch">WHAT IS SOFTWARE ARCHITECT?</h3>
    <p id="vtorPar">A software architect is an individual who holds a multifaceted role
      within the realm of software development. Their primary responsibility lies in designing
      software solutions that effectively tackle the challenges and requirements faced by companies or clients.
      While traditional architects design physical structures, software architects focus on creating the blueprint and
      framework for software systems.The role of a software architect goes beyond just designing solutions.
      They also assume leadership responsibilities by overseeing a team of developers.
      This entails assigning and managing project tasks, engaging with clients to ensure that the proposed solution
      aligns with their needs and expectations, and providing regular updates on the progress of the project.
      Additionally, software architects play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation and coordination of all
      aspects of the software development process.</p>
